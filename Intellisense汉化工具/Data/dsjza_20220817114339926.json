This mode uses a shift register that is one block in length and is divided into sections. For example, if the block size is 8 bytes, with one byte processed at a time, the shift register is divided into eight sections. If a bit in the cipher text is mangled, one plain text bit is mangled and the shift register is corrupted. This results in the next several plain text increments being mangled until the bad bit is shifted out of the shift register.

Any blocks of plain text that are identical and in the same message, or that are in a different message encrypted with the same key, will be transformed into identical cipher text blocks. Important:  This mode is not recommended because it opens the door for multiple security exploits. If the plain text to be encrypted contains substantial repetition, it is feasible for the cipher text to be broken one block at a time. It is also possible to use block analysis to determine the encryption key. Also, an active adversary can substitute and exchange individual blocks without detection, which allows blocks to be saved and inserted into the stream at other points without detection.":"）模式单独加密每个块。任何相同且在同一消息中或在使用相同键加密的消息中的任何纯文本块都将转换为相同的密码文本块。重要的是：不建议使用此模式，因为它为多个安全漏洞打开了大门。如果要加密的纯文本包含实质性重复，则可以使密码文本一次折断一个块是可行的。也可以使用块分析来确定加密密钥。此外，活跃的对手可以无检测来替换和交换单个块，从而使块在没有检测的情况下将块保存并插入流中。\r\n","<MyElement/>":"<merelement/>\r\n","Queues the specified work to run on the thread pool and returns a ":"排队指定的工作以在线程池上运行并返回\r\n","Specifies the inheritance and auditing behavior of an access control entry (ACE).":"指定访问控制条目（ACE）的继承和审核行为。\r\n","Checks for sufficient memory resources before executing an operation.
