Optionally, the function computes jacobians - matrices of partial derivatives of image points as functions of all the input parameters w.r.t. the particular parameters, intrinsic and/or extrinsic. The jacobians are used during the global optimization in cvCalibrateCamera2 and cvFindExtrinsicCameraParams2. The function itself is also used to compute back-projection error for with current intrinsic and extrinsic parameters.\r\n            Note, that with intrinsic and/or extrinsic parameters set to special values, the function can be used to compute just extrinsic transformation or just intrinsic transformation (i.e. distortion of a sparse set of points). \r\n            ":"给定内在和外在相机参数，计算 3D 点到图像平面的投影。可选地，该函数计算 jacobians - 图像点的偏导数矩阵作为所有输入参数 w.r.t 的函数。特定的参数，内在的和/或外在的。雅可比矩阵在 cvCalibrateCamera2 和 cvFindExtrinsicCameraParams2 的全局优化过程中使用。该函数本身也用于计算当前内部和外部参数的反投影误差。\r\n            请注意，将内在和/或外在参数设置为特殊值时，该函数可用于仅计算外在变换或仅计算内在变换（即稀疏点集的失真）。\r\n            \r\n","\r\n            Subtracts two vectors.\r\n            ":"\r\n            减去两个向量。\r\n            \r\n","FileParser.ResolveFilesAlgorithm":"FileParser.ResolveFiles算法\r\n","\r\n            CIL opcode operand type\r\n            ":"\r\n            CIL 操作码操作数类型\r\n            \r\n","The lock token of the corresponding message to dead-letter.":"死信对应消息的锁定令牌。\r\n","PropertyMap table (15h)":"PropertyMap 表（15 小时）\r\n","Different flags":"不同的标志\r\n"," pop.\r\n            ":" 流行音乐。\r\n            \r\n","Field type or ":"字段类型或\r\n","\r\n            Current version of {EngineName} doesn't support referencing assemblies \" + \"which are\r\n            not loaded from the file location.\r\n            ":"\r\n            {EngineName} 的当前版本不支持引用程序集“+”\r\n            未从文件位置加载。\r\n            \r\n","The name of the engine.":"引擎的名称。\r\n","\r\n            Indicates whether this subscription has dead letter support when a message expires.\r\n            ":"\r\n            指示此订阅在消息过期时是否支持死信。\r\n            \r\n","\r\n            Returns the NumberOfRvaAndSizes field\r\n            ":"\r\n            返回 NumberOfRvaAndSizes 字段\r\n            \r\n","RVA of this stub":"此存根的 RVA\r\n","Returns a string that represents the current message.":"返回表示当前消息的字符串。\r\n","Focal length in real-world units ":"以实际单位表示的焦距\r\n","\r\n            Returns a boolean indicating whether the rect is equal to the other given rect.\r\n            ":"\r\n            返回一个布尔值，指示该矩形是否等于另一个给定的矩形。\r\n            \r\n","The starting offset of the ":"的起始偏移量\r\n","\r\n            Determines whether to use GPU for rendering in your project.
