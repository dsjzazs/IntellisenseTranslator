We start with the highest power (least significant bit) of\r\n             q and repeat for all eight bits of q.\r\n            \r\n             This implementation uses sixteen lookup tables stored in one linear array\r\n             to implement the slicing-by-16 algorithm, a variant of the slicing-by-8\r\n             algorithm described in this Intel white paper:\r\n            \r\n             https://web.archive.org/web/20120722193753/http://download.intel.com/technology/comms/perfnet/download/slicing-by-8.pdf\r\n            \r\n             The first lookup table is simply the CRC of all possible eight bit values.\r\n             Each successive lookup table is derived from the original table generated\r\n             by Sarwate's algorithm. Slicing a 16-bit input and XORing the outputs\r\n             together will produce the same output as a byte-by-byte CRC loop with\r\n             fewer arithmetic and bit manipulation operations, at the cost of increased\r\n             memory consumed by the lookup tables. (Slicing-by-16 requires a 16KB table,\r\n             which is still small enough to fit in most processors' L1 cache.)\r\n             ":"\r\n             在多项式上生成一个字节32位CRC计算表:\r\n             x^32+x^26+x^23+x^22+x^16+x^12+x^11+x^10+x^8+x^7+x^5+x^4+x^2+x^1+x^0。\r\n            \r\n             GF(2)上的多项式用二进制表示，每个系数一位,\r\n             在最高有效位具有最低功率。  然后添加多项式\r\n             只是排他性的-或者，多项式乘以x是右移\r\n             一个。  如果我们调用上述多项式p，并将一个字节表示为\r\n             多项式q，也与最低功率在最高有效位（所以\r\n             字节0xb1为多项式x^7+x^3+x+1)，则CRC为(q*x^32)mod p,\r\n             其中a mod b表示a除以b后的余数。\r\n            \r\n             该计算是使用移位寄存器的方法进行乘法和\r\n             取余数。  寄存器初始化为零，并为每\r\n             传入位，x^32被添加mod p到寄存器，如果该位是一个（其中\r\n             x^32mod p为p+x^32=x^26+。..+1），并将寄存器乘以mod p\r\n             x（如果位移位，则向右移一，并添加x^32mod p\r\n             出是一个）。  我们从最高功率（最低有效位）开始\r\n             q并重复所有8位q。\r\n            \r\n             此实现使用存储在一个线性数组中的十六个查找表\r\n             为了实现slicing-by-16算法，slicing-by-8的变体\r\n             本英特尔白皮书中描述的算法:\r\n            \r\n             https://web.archive.org/web/20120722193753/http://download.intel.com/technology/comms/perfnet/download/slicing-by-8.pdf\r\n            \r\n             第一个查找表只是所有可能的八位值的CRC。\r\n             每个连续的查找表都是从生成的原始表中派生出来的\r\n             通过Sarwate的算法。 对16位输入进行切片并对输出进行异或\r\n             一起将产生相同的输出作为一个字节一个字节的CRC循环与\r\n             更少的算术和位操作，代价是增加\r\n             查找表消耗的内存。 （按16切片需要16KB表,\r\n             它仍然足够小，可以容纳大多数处理器的L1缓存。)\r\n             \r\n","\r\n            Represents a strongly-typed ":"\r\n            代表着强烈的\r\n","Info.":"信息。\r\n"," to carry out.":" 进行。\r\n","buffer to copy to":"缓冲区复制到\r\n","\r\n            Get/set the ascii file translation flag.

LOH allocations - since all large buffers are pooled, they will never incur a Gen2 GC\r\n            2. Memory waste - A standard memory stream doubles its size when it runs out of room. This\r\n            leads to continual memory growth as each stream approaches the maximum allowed size.\r\n            3. Memory copying - Each time a MemoryStream grows, all the bytes are copied into new buffers.\r\n            This implementation only copies the bytes when GetBuffer is called.\r\n            4. Memory fragmentation - By using homogeneous buffer sizes, it ensures that blocks of memory\r\n            can be easily reused.\r\n            \r\n            The stream is implemented on top of a series of uniformly-sized blocks. As the stream's length grows,\r\n            additional blocks are retrieved from the memory manager. It is these blocks that are pooled, not the stream\r\n            object itself.\r\n            \r\n            The biggest wrinkle in this implementation is when GetBuffer() is called. This requires a single \r\n            contiguous buffer. If only a single block is in use, then that block is returned. If multiple blocks \r\n            are in use, we retrieve a larger buffer from the memory manager. These large buffers are also pooled, \r\n            split by size--they are multiples of a chunk size (1 MB by default).\r\n            \r\n            Once a large buffer is assigned to the stream the blocks are NEVER again used for this stream. All operations take place on the \r\n            large buffer. The large buffer can be replaced by a larger buffer from the pool as needed. All blocks and large buffers \r\n            are maintained in the stream until the stream is disposed (unless AggressiveBufferReturn is enabled in the stream manager).\r\n            \r\n            ":"\r\n            该课程与RecylableMorystreamManager共同起作用\r\n            对呼叫者的对象，同时避免了这些特定问题：\r\n            1. LOH分配 - 由于所有大型缓冲区均已合并，它们将永远不会产生GEN2 GC\r\n            2.内存浪费 - 标准内存流耗尽房间时的尺寸加倍。这个\r\n            随着每个流接近最大允许的大小，导致记忆的持续增长。\r\n            3.内存复制 - 每次存储器增长时，所有字节都会复制到新的缓冲区中。\r\n            此实现仅在调用GetBuffer时复制字节。\r\n            4.内存碎片 - 通过使用均匀的缓冲尺寸，它可以确保内存块\r\n            可以很容易地重复使用。\r\n            \r\n            该流是在一系列均匀大小的块的顶部实现的。随着流的长度的增长，\r\n            从内存管理器检索其他块。这些块是汇总的，而不是流\r\n            对象本身。\r\n            \r\n            此实现中最大的皱纹是何时调用GetBuffer（）。这需要一个\r\n            连续缓冲区。如果仅使用一个块，则返回该块。如果多个块\r\n            在使用中，我们从内存管理器中检索较大的缓冲区。这些大型缓冲区也被合并，\r\n            按尺寸拆分 - 它们是块大小的倍数（默认情况下为1 MB）。\r\n            \r\n            一旦将大型缓冲区分配到流中，该块将不再用于该流。所有操作都在\r\n            大型缓冲区。大型缓冲液可以根据需要从池中取代较大的缓冲区。所有块和大型缓冲区\r\n            保持在流中，直到处置流为止（除非在流管理器中启用了AggressiveBufferRetrurn）。\r\n            \r\n            \r\n","\r\n            Extensions for MethodInfo that are not available in pre-4.5 .NET releases\r\n            ":"\r\n            pre-4.5 .NET版本中不可用的MethodInfo的扩展名\r\n            \r\n","The number of bits to peek.":"窥视的数量。\r\n","\r\n            Apply a constraint to an actual value, succeeding if the constraint\r\n            fails and issuing a warning on failure.\r\n            ":"\r\n            将约束应用于实际值，如果约束\r\n            失败并发出有关失败的警告。\r\n            \r\n","Used to send a Connection.Open.
