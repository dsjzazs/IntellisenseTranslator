Also, we want to be able to\r\n            generate these hashes without allocating any memory.  My ideal solution would be to use an\r\n            MD5 hash.

So,\r\n            instead, we use murmur hash since it provides well distributed values, allows for a\r\n            seed, and allocates no memory.\r\n            \r\n            Murmur hash is public domain.

For example, given the IDs for the FilePath\r\n            and Name of a Project, we can get an ID that represents the project itself by just\r\n            creating a compound key of those two IDs.  This ID can then be used in other compound\r\n            situations.  For example, a Document's ID is creating by compounding its Project's \r\n            ID, along with the IDs for the Document's FilePath and Name.\r\n            \r\n            The format of the table is:\r\n            \r\n             StringInfo\r\n             --------------------------------------------------------------\r\n             | Id (integer, primary key, auto increment) | Data (varchar) |\r\n             --------------------------------------------------------------\r\n            ":"\r\n            在数据库内部，我们有一个专门用于存储字符串的表，该表还提供了一个唯一的\r\n            每个字符串的完整 ID。这使我们能够更有效地存储键入的数据\r\n            方式，因为我们可以使用这些 ID 而不是在各处复制字符串。为了\r\n            例如，可能有许多数据与一个文件相关联。我们不想\r\n            在所有这些地方关闭文件路径，因为这会导致大量膨胀。\r\n            \r\n            因为字符串表可以从任意字符串映射到唯一 ID，所以它也可以是\r\n            用于为复合对象创建 ID。例如，给定 FilePath 的 ID\r\n            和项目名称，我们可以得到一个代表项目本身的ID\r\n            创建这两个 ID 的复合键。然后可以在其他化合物中使用此 ID\r\n            情况。例如，文档的 ID 是通过复合其项目的 ID 创建的\r\n            ID，以及文档的文件路径和名称的 ID。\r\n            \r\n            表格格式为：\r\n            \r\n             字符串信息\r\n             ---------------------------------------------- --------------\r\n             | Id（整数，主键，自增）|数据（可变字符） |\r\n             ---------------------------------------------- --------------\r\n            \r\n","\r\n            Translates an ":"\r\n            翻译一个\r\n","\r\n            The module version ID in which the method exists.\r\n            ":"\r\n            该方法所在的模块版本 ID。\r\n            \r\n","Source type.":"来源类型。\r\n","Copy of WebConvert.TryKeyStringToTime.":"WebConvert.TryKeyStringToTime 的副本。\r\n","\"mod\" keyword for expressions.":"表达式的“mod”关键字。\r\n","\r\n                The indexed property '{property}' cannot be added to type '{entityType}' because the CLR class contains a member with the same name.\r\n            ":"\r\n                无法将索引属性“{property}”添加到类型“{entityType}”，因为 CLR 类包含同名成员。\r\n            \r\n","\r\n            Translate a MetadataSegment\r\n            ":"\r\n            翻译元数据段\r\n            \r\n"," for a parameter with the given name.\r\n            ":" 对于具有给定名称的参数。\r\n            \r\n","\r\n            Validates that the specified nested resource info has cardinality, that is it has the IsCollection value set.\r\n            ":"\r\n            验证指定的嵌套资源信息是否具有基数，即它具有 IsCollection 值集。\r\n            \r\n","String representation of the filter expression.":"过滤器表达式的字符串表示形式。\r\n","\r\n            If the string starts with '$', removes it.\r\n            Also asserts that the 2nd character is also '$', as otherwise the string would be treated as a system segment.\r\n            ":"\r\n            如果字符串以“$”开头，则将其删除。\r\n            还断言第二个字符也是“$”，否则字符串将被视为系统段。\r\n            \r\n","\r\n            Visits a FunctionParameterToken\r\n            ":"\r\n            访问 FunctionParameterToken\r\n            \r\n"," The method.
