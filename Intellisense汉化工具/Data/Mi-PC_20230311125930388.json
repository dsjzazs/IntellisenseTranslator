Since the Gregorian calendar was not implemented\r\n            until October 4, 1582 (or later in some countries), Gregorian dates prior to that time are\r\n            really dates that would have been, had the Gregorian calendar existed.  In order to avoid\r\n            throwing an exception, for dates prior to 1 AD, the year will be converted to a positive\r\n            year and the text \"(BC)\" is appended to the end of the formatted string.  Under this mode, the\r\n            year sequence is 2BC, 1BC, 1AD, 2AD, etc.  There is no year zero.\r\n            ":"\r\n            是预计的公历日期。由于没有实行公历\r\n            直到 1582 年 10 月 4 日（或在某些国家/地区更晚），该时间之前的公历日期是\r\n            如果公历存在的话，真的会是这样的日期。为了避免\r\n            抛出异常，对于公元 1 年之前的日期，年份将被转换为正数\r\n            年份和文本“(BC)”附加到格式化字符串的末尾。在这种模式下，\r\n            年份顺序为 2BC、1BC、1AD、2AD 等。没有年份零。\r\n            \r\n","\r\n            Converts an angle in gradians to radians.\r\n            ":"\r\n            将以 gradians 为单位的角度转换为弧度。\r\n            \r\n","\r\n            Gets or sets the target property for the keyframe.\r\n            ":"\r\n            获取或设置关键帧的目标属性。\r\n            \r\n","\r\n            Set the size of the popup that is to be positioned with the positioner object, in device-\r\n            independent pixels.\r\n            ":"\r\n            在 device- 中设置要使用定位器对象定位的弹出窗口的大小\r\n            独立像素。\r\n            \r\n","\r\n            Defines the application-global data templates.\r\n            ":"\r\n            定义应用程序全局数据模板。\r\n            \r\n","\r\n            Locate the ":"\r\n            找到\r\n","The string value to search for.":"要搜索的字符串值。\r\n","'s with an explicit number of rows: The first column has\r\n            3 rows and the second column has 2 rows for a total of 5 panes.\r\n            ":"具有明确的行数：第一列有\r\n            3 行，第二列有 2 行，总共 5 个窗格。\r\n            \r\n"," object assuming a even linear distribution of the colors\r\n            across the gradient.\r\n            ":" 假设颜色呈均匀线性分布的对象\r\n            跨越梯度。\r\n            \r\n",", and the\r\n            ":", 和\r\n            \r\n","The method to call to initialize the rendering subsystem.":"调用以初始化渲染子系统的方法。\r\n"," Bob Kaye ":" 鲍勃·凯\r\n",").\r\n            You can control the available range of scrolling with the ":").\r\n            您可以使用\r\n"," type for this method\r\n            to work.\r\n            ":" 键入此方法\r\n            上班。\r\n            \r\n"," corresponding to this event":" 对应这个事件\r\n","\r\n            Set the calendar date (year, month, day) of this instance.\r\n            ":"\r\n            设置此实例的日历日期（年、月、日）。\r\n            \r\n","\r\n            Defines a geometric shape.\r\n            ":"\r\n            定义几何形状。\r\n            \r\n"," instance containing\r\n            the data to be regressed.":" 实例包含\r\n            要回归的数据。\r\n","\r\n            The integer millisecond value (e.g., 374 for 374 milliseconds past the second).\r\n            ":"整数毫秒值（例如，374 表示秒后 374 毫秒）。\r\n            \r\n","\r\n            The property that changed.\r\n            ":"\r\n            更改的属性。\r\n            \r\n","\r\n            The Astronomical Julian Day number that corresponds to XL Date 0.0\r\n            ":"\r\n            XL Date 0.0对应的天文儒略日数\r\n            \r\n","\r\n            Gets the index of the first character in the span.\r\n            ":"\r\n            获取跨度中第一个字符的索引。\r\n            \r\n","\r\n            method call, and affects the selection of the major step size (":"\r\n            方法调用，并影响主要步长的选择（\r\n"," is zero if the last item\r\n            overflows the panel bounds.\r\n            ":" 如果最后一项为零\r\n            溢出面板边界。\r\n            \r\n","\r\n            Gets or sets a value that indicates where to draw \r\n            tick marks in relation to the track.\r\n            ":"\r\n            获取或设置一个值，该值指示绘制位置\r\n            与轨道相关的刻度线。\r\n            \r\n","\r\n                Gets the recommended distance above the baseline in design em size. \r\n            ":"\r\n                获取设计 em 大小中基线上方的推荐距离。\r\n            \r\n","The color in which to draw the labels":"绘制标签的颜色\r\n"," graphs, and only when the\r\n            ":" 图，并且只有当\r\n            \r\n",".\r\n            If the arrays are of different size, then the larger array prevails and the\r\n            smaller array is padded with ":".\r\n            如果数组的大小不同，则以较大的数组为准，\r\n            较小的数组填充有\r\n","\r\n            The value to set.

This is done because applying bindings as soon\r\n            as controls are created means that long-form bindings (i.e. bindings that don't use the\r\n            `{Binding}` markup extension but instead use `<Binding>`) don't work, as the binding\r\n            is applied to the property before the properties on the `Binding` object are set. Looking \r\n            at WPF it uses a similar mechanism for bindings that come from XAML.\r\n            ":"\r\n            XAML 引擎以延迟方式应用其绑定，​​其中仅应用绑定\r\n            当控件完成初始化时。这样做是因为尽快应用绑定\r\n            随着控件的创建意味着长格式绑定（即不使用\r\n            `{Binding}` 标记扩展，而是使用 `<Binding>`) 不起作用，因为绑定\r\n            在设置 `Binding` 对象的属性之前应用于该属性。看着\r\n            在 WPF 中，它对来自 XAML 的绑定使用类似的机制。\r\n            \r\n","\r\n            Determines what Y data will be returned by the indexer of this list.\r\n            ":"确定此列表的索引器将返回哪些 Y 数据。\r\n            \r\n","\r\n            The default color for the line.\r\n            This is the default value for the ":"\r\n            线条的默认颜色。\r\n            这是默认值\r\n","\r\n            The default pane layout for\r\n            ":"\r\n            的默认窗格布局\r\n            \r\n","\r\n            When using ReverseMap, ignores all ":"\r\n            使用 ReverseMap 时，忽略所有\r\n","\r\n                Tries to get an glyph index for specified codepoint.\r\n            ":"\r\n                尝试获取指定代码点的字形索引。\r\n            \r\n"," object by \r\n            its ordinal position in the list. \r\n            ":" 对象\r\n            它在列表中的顺序位置。\r\n            \r\n","\r\n            Gets a value indicating whether a value is present.\r\n            ":"\r\n            获取一个值，该值指示值是否存在。\r\n            \r\n","The type of the element that should be used as a part with name.":"应该用作带有名称的部分的元素的类型。\r\n","\r\n            Gets or sets the custom method that uses user-entered text to filter\r\n            the items specified by the\r\n            ":"\r\n            获取或设置使用用户输入的文本进行过滤的自定义方法\r\n            指定的项目\r\n            \r\n","\r\n            Enumerates the children of an ":"\r\n            枚举一个的孩子\r\n","\r\n            Filters BottomRight value.\r\n            ":"\r\n            过滤 BottomRight 值。\r\n            \r\n","\r\n            Pushes a clip geometry.\r\n            ":"\r\n            推动剪辑几何体。\r\n            \r\n","\r\n            Defines an \"Avalonia Module\", a 3rd party extension to Avalonia that can be automatically initialized by an AppBuilder instance.\r\n            ":"\r\n            定义“Avalonia 模块”，Avalonia 的第 3 方扩展，可以由 AppBuilder 实例自动初始化。\r\n            \r\n","\r\n            Copy the properties from this ":"\r\n            从此复制属性\r\n","The string \"(do nothing)\".":"字符串“（什么都不做）”。\r\n","\r\n            Loads some pseudo unique colors/symbols into this CurveItem.
