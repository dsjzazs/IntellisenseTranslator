This prevents asynchronous access from corrupting\r\n            the state of the enumeration until the collection has been fully copied.\r\n            \r\n            Since we use the mutable ignore case comparer we need to make sure that we lock our self before we call the comparer since the comparer can call back \r\n            into this dictionary which could cause a deadlock if another thread is also accessing another method in the dictionary.\r\n            ":"\r\n            这添加到Idictionary <string，t>的值是：\r\n                 - 强制执行该键= t.name\r\n                 - 默认枚举器超过值\r\n                 - （边际）执行正确的密钥比较\r\n                 - 有可能在写作上复制\r\n            \r\n            确实是一个字典<string，t>，其中键（名称）是从ikeed.key获得的。\r\n            无法观察到，因此，如果客户希望观察修改，他们必须自己调解它们，并且\r\n            要么不揭露此系列，要么通过可阅读的包装器将其暴露。\r\n            在此班级的各个地方，锁定收藏集。原因是允许\r\n            这个课程是异步列举的。这是由CopyOnReadenumerable实现的\r\n            锁定收藏集时，它进行深层克隆。这样可以防止异步访问损坏\r\n            枚举状态，直到收集已完全复制为止。\r\n            \r\n            由于我们使用可忽略的案例比较器，因此我们需要确保在调用比较之前锁定自己，因为比较可以回电\r\n            如果另一个线程也访问字典中的另一种方法，则可能会导致僵局。\r\n            \r\n",", where the inner Task represents work done as part of the outer Task{TResult}.  However, \r\n            doing so results in a Task{Task}, which, if not dealt with carefully, could produce unexpected behavior.

This prevents asynchronous access from corrupting\r\n             the state of the enumeration until the collection has been fully copied.\r\n            \r\n             The use of a CopyOnWriteDictionary does not reduce the concurrency of this collection, because CopyOnWriteDictionary\r\n             offers the same concurrency guarantees (concurrent readers OR single writer) for EACH user of the dictionary.\r\n             \r\n             Since we use the mutable ignore case comparer we need to make sure that we lock our self before we call the comparer since the comparer can call back \r\n             into this dictionary which could cause a deadlock if another thread is also accessing another method in the dictionary.\r\n             ":"\r\n             这添加到Idictionary <string，t>的值是：\r\n                  - 强制执行该键= t.name\r\n                  - 默认枚举器超过值\r\n                  - （边际）执行正确的密钥比较\r\n                  - 有可能在写作上复制\r\n             \r\n             确实是一个字典<string，t>，其中键（名称）是从ikeed.key获得的。\r\n             无法观察到，因此，如果客户希望观察修改，他们必须自己调解它们，并且\r\n             要么不揭露此系列，要么通过可阅读的包装器将其暴露。\r\n            \r\n             在此班级的各个地方，锁定收藏集。原因是允许\r\n             这个课程是异步列举的。这是由CopyOnReadenumerable实现的\r\n             锁定收藏集时，它进行深层克隆。这样可以防止异步访问损坏\r\n             枚举状态，直到收集已完全复制为止。\r\n            \r\n             使用CopyOnwriteDictionary不会降低此集合的并发性，因为CopyOnwritedictionary\r\n             为词典的每个用户提供相同的并发保证（并发读者或单个作者）。\r\n             \r\n             由于我们使用可忽略的案例比较器，因此我们需要确保在调用比较之前锁定自己，因为比较可以回电\r\n             如果另一个线程也访问字典中的另一种方法，则可能会导致僵局。\r\n             \r\n","\r\n            A variation of Path.GetFullPath that will return the input value\r\n            instead of throwing any IO exception.\r\n            Useful to get a better path for an error message, without the risk of throwing\r\n            if the error message was itself caused by the path being invalid!\r\n            ":"\r\n            路径的变体。getFullPath将返回输入值\r\n            而不是抛出任何IO例外。\r\n            有助于获得错误消息的更好的途径，而无需投掷风险\r\n            如果错误消息本身是由于路径无效而引起的！\r\n            \r\n","\r\n            Helper to convert into a read-only dictionary of string, string.\r\n            ":"\r\n            助手转换为字符串的仅读取字典。\r\n            \r\n"," class \r\n            with the specified ":" 班级\r\n            与指定的\r\n"," if the warning should be treated as a low importance message, otherwise ":" 如果应将警告视为低重要的消息，否则\r\n","\r\n            Cannot return null from an action method with a return type of '{0}'.\r\n            ":"\r\n            无法从返回类型的“ {0}”的返回类型中返回null。\r\n            \r\n","\r\n            Returns all the currently defined loggers in the repository\r\n            ":"\r\n            返回存储库中当前定义的日志\r\n            \r\n","Represents the factory for creating new instance of ":"代表创建新实例的工厂\r\n","\r\n            Bad chunk size data.\r\n            ":"\r\n            不良块大小数据。\r\n            \r\n","Count has snapshot semantics and represents the number of items in the ":"计数具有快照语义，代表了该项目的数量\r\n",". \r\n            That is, if the media type and media type parameters of ":"。\r\n            也就是说，如果媒体类型和媒体类型参数\r\n","\r\n            in that it accepts a pattern and renders it to a string.

Because length is used for bounds checking into the int array,\r\n            it's especially important to get this correct for the stackalloc version.

The .Net serialization mechanism is inefficient, even if you implement ISerializable\r\n               with your own custom mechanism.  This is because the serializer uses a bag called\r\n               SerializationInfo into which you are expected to drop all your data.  This adds\r\n               an unnecessary level of indirection to the serialization routines and prevents direct,\r\n               efficient access to the byte-stream.\r\n            2. You have to implement both a reader and writer part, which introduces the potential for\r\n               error should the classes be later modified.  If the reader and writer methods are not\r\n               kept in perfect sync, serialization errors will occur.  Our custom serializer eliminates\r\n               that by ensuring a single Translate method on a given object can handle both reads and\r\n               writes without referencing any field more than once.\r\n            ":"\r\n            我们打扰自定义序列化机制的原因是两个方面：\r\n            1. .NET序列化机制效率低下，即使您实现了iSerializizable\r\n               使用您自己的自定义机制。这是因为序列化器使用一个称为的袋子\r\n               序列化Info将您删除所有数据。这增加了\r\n               对序列化例程的不必要的间接水平，并防止直接\r\n               有效访问字节流。\r\n            2.您必须同时实施读者和作家部分，这引入了潜力\r\n               错误应以后修改。如果读者和作家方法不是\r\n               保持完美同步，将发生序列化错误。我们的自定义序列化器消除了\r\n               通过确保给定对象上的单个翻译方法可以处理读取和\r\n               写信而无需引用任何字段。\r\n            \r\n","The name of the view that is rendered to the response.":"响应呈现的视图名称。\r\n","\r\n            that apply to ":"\r\n            适用于\r\n","\r\n            The key into the Properties map for the thread identity value.\r\n            ":"\r\n            线程身份值的属性映射的键。\r\n            \r\n","\r\n            Additivity is set to true by default, that is children inherit\r\n            the appenders of their ancestors by default.

This ensures each string is transmitted exactly once.\r\n            ":"\r\n            该Interner通过提供将字符串转换为整数ID的方法来起作用。当用作压缩形式时\r\n            客户将实现他们的字符串并记录返回的ID集，然后传输这些ID而不是\r\n            原始字符串。 Interner本身还会提前传输ID，允许\r\n            原始字符串的重建。这样可以确保每个字符串被精确地发送一次。\r\n            \r\n","The name of the string resource to load.":"要加载的字符串资源的名称。\r\n"," is empty; otherwise,\r\n            false.":" 是空的;否则，\r\n            错误的。\r\n","\r\n            string s = OptionConverter.SubstituteVariables(\"Value of nonExistentKey is [${nonExistentKey}]\");\r\n            ":"\r\n            字符串s = optionConverter.SubstituteVariobles（“ nontoxistEntKey的值是[$ {nontoxistEntKey}]”）;\r\n            \r\n"," if either of \r\n            ":" 如果有\r\n            \r\n"," that is suitable to use with a hash-based collection.\r\n            ":" 这适用于基于哈希的集合。\r\n            \r\n","%-20.30logger":"％-20.30logger\r\n","\r\n            Each assembly is immediately followed by assemblies specified by annotated ":"\r\n            每个组件紧随其后的是通过注释指定的组件\r\n","\r\n            Determine the 32 bit program files directory, this is used for finding where the reference assemblies live.\r\n            ":"\r\n            确定32位程序文件目录，用于查找参考组件的现场位置。\r\n            \r\n","\r\n            This function is only meant to be invoked by a debugger remotely. \r\n            It should not be called by any other codepaths.\r\n            ":"\r\n            此功能仅是远程调试器调用的。\r\n            任何其他编码器都不应调用它。\r\n            \r\n","\r\n            Move to the next object if any,\r\n            otherwise returns false\r\n            ":"\r\n            如果有的话，移至下一个对象，\r\n            否则返回false\r\n            \r\n","\r\n            Writes item vector transforms embedded in the given string without escaping '->' into \"-&gt;\".\r\n            ":"\r\n            将项目向量转换为嵌入在给定的字符串中的情况，而不会逃脱“  - >”中的“  - ＆gt;”。\r\n            \r\n","\r\n            Determines whether the specified content is MIME multipart content with the \r\n            specified subtype.
