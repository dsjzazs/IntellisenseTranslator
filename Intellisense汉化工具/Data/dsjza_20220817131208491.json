Note that workers get assigned\r\n             next job ids before they push the completed jobs to the consumer. So the workers are\r\n             then subject to being blocked until their current completed jobs are fully accepted\r\n             (i.e. added to the to-consume queue).\r\n            \r\n             How it works:\r\n             Suppose we have 7 workers (w0,..,w6) and 14 jobs (j0,..,j13).\r\n             Initially, jobs get assigned to workers using a shared counter.\r\n             Here is an example outcome of using a shared counter:\r\n             w1->j0, w6->j1, w0->j2, w3->j3, w4->j4, w5->j5, w2->j6.\r\n            \r\n             Suppose workers finished jobs in the following order:\r\n             w5->j5, w0->j2, w6->j1, w4->j4, w3->j3,w1->j0, w2->j6.\r\n            \r\n             w5 finishes processing j5 first, but will be blocked until the processing of jobs\r\n             j0,..,j4 completes since the consumer can consume jobs in order only.\r\n             Therefore, the next available job (j7) should not be assigned to w5. It should be\r\n             assigned to the worker whose job *get consumed first* (w1 since it processes j0\r\n             which is the first job) *not* to the worker who completes its job first (w5 in\r\n             this example).\r\n            \r\n             So, a shared counter can be used to assign jobs to workers initially but should\r\n             not be used onwards.\r\n             ":"\r\n             一个简单的工作调度程序，将可用作业（用于处理的批处理/块）分配给\r\n             免费工人（光标/线程）。该调度程序将完成的作业的ID带入\r\n             分配下一个工作时的帐户以最大程度地减少工人的等待时间\r\n             完成的作业（又称合并器，请参见：dataviewutils.consolidategeneric）可以\r\n             仅按顺序摄入工作 - 根据其IDS-进行工作。请注意，工人被分配了\r\n             在将完成的工作推向消费者之前，下一个工作ID。所以工人是\r\n             然后被阻止，直到他们当前完成的工作被完全接受\r\n             （即添加到待办事项队列）。\r\n            \r\n             这个怎么运作：\r\n             假设我们有7名工人（W0，..，W6）和14个工作（J0，..，J13）。\r\n             最初，使用共享计数器将作业分配给工人。\r\n             这是使用共享计数器的示例结果：\r\n             W1-> J0，W6-> J1，W0-> J2，W3-> J3，W4-> J4，W5-> J5，W2-> J6。\r\n            \r\n             假设工人按以下顺序完成工作：\r\n             W5-> J5，W0-> J2，W6-> J1，W4-> J4，W3-> J3，W1-> J0，W2-> J6。\r\n            \r\n             W5首先完成处理J5的处理，但将被阻止直到工作处理\r\n             J0，..，J4完成，因为消费者只能按顺序消费工作。\r\n             因此，不应将下一个可用的作业（J7）分配给W5。它应该是\r\n             分配给工作 *首先消耗 *的工人（W1，因为它处理J0\r\n             这是第一份工作） *不是 *首先完成工作的工人（W5 IN\r\n             这个示例）。\r\n            \r\n             因此，共享计数器最初可用于将作业分配给工人，但应\r\n             不继续使用。\r\n             \r\n","The name of the label column.

The factory is a reusable object,\r\n            created with data and cursor options. From external non-implementing users it will\r\n            appear to be more or less stateless, but internally it is keeping track of what sorts\r\n            of filtering it needs to perform. For example, if we construct the factory with the\r\n            option that it needs to filter out rows with bad feature values, but on the first\r\n            iteration it is revealed there are no bad feature values, then it would be a complete\r\n            waste of time to check on subsequent iterations over the data whether there are bad\r\n            feature values again.\r\n            ":"\r\n            这是数据光标工厂的基类。工厂是可重复使用的对象，\r\n            使用数据和光标选项创建。从外部非实施用户中\r\n            似乎或多或少是无国籍的，但在内部，它正在跟踪什么样\r\n            过滤需要执行。例如，如果我们用\r\n            它需要以不良功能值过滤的行进行滤波，但在第一个\r\n            迭代揭示没有不良的特征值，那么它将是完整的\r\n            浪费时间检查后续迭代是否有坏的数据\r\n            再次功能值。\r\n            \r\n","\r\n            Scale features by this value.\r\n            ":"\r\n            根据此值的比例功能。\r\n            \r\n"," at the reader's current position.\r\n            ":" 在读者的当前位置。\r\n            \r\n","to import.":"进口。\r\n","The progress reporting channel.":"进度报告渠道。\r\n","Whether we should attempt to shuffle the source data.

The buffer is accessed in a \"circular\" fashion.) Consider that this portion\r\n             is broken into three distinct regions: there is a sort of middle \"sampling\" region\r\n             (usually of size P but possibly smaller when we've reached the end of the input and so are\r\n             running out of rows to sample), a region before this sampling region composed of already\r\n             sampled \"dead\" rows, and a \"presampling\" region after this sampling region composed of\r\n             rows ready to be sampled in future iterations, but that we are not sampling yet (in order\r\n             to behave equivalently to the simple logical model of at any given time sampling P items).\r\n             The producer owns the complement of the portion owned by the consumer.\r\n            \r\n             As the cursor progresses, the producer fills in successive items in its portion of the\r\n             buffer it owns, and passes them off to the consumer (not one item at a time, but rather in\r\n             batches, to keep down the amount of intertask communication). The consumer in addition to\r\n             taking ownership of these items, will also periodically pass dead items back to the producer\r\n             (again, not one dead item at a time, but in batches when the number of dead items reaches\r\n             a certain threshold).\r\n            \r\n             This communication is accomplished using a pair of BufferBlock instances, through which\r\n             the producer and consumer are notified how many additional items they can take ownership\r\n             of.\r\n            \r\n             As the consumer \"selects\" a row from the pool of selectable rows each time it moves to\r\n             the next row, this randomly selected row is considered to be the \"first\" index, since this\r\n             makes its subsequent transition to being a dead row much simpler. It would be inefficient to\r\n             swap all the values in each column's buffer to accomplish this to make the selected row\r\n             first, of course, so one rather swaps an index, so that these nicely behavior contiguous\r\n             circular indices, get mapped in an index within the buffers, through a permutation maintained\r\n             in the pipeIndices array.\r\n            \r\n             The result is something functionally equivalent to but but considerably faster than the\r\n             simple implementation described in the first paragraph.\r\n             ":"\r\n             这描述了行光标。让我们想象我们实例化了我们的洗牌转换\r\n             在大小的大小池上\r\n             p并且每当您随机采样并从中产生一行时，该行被丢弃\r\n             并用输入源光标的下一行替换。\r\n            \r\n             也可以以与此逻辑紧密分裂的方式实施\r\n             解释，但这是效率低下的。相反，我们有更大尺寸的缓冲区\r\n             p+b。消费者（大概是在主线程中运行）采样和获取项目，\r\n             生产者（在任务中运行，可能在其他线程中运行）填充缓冲区\r\n             使用该物品进行采样，利用此额外的空间来启用有效的\r\n             多线程方案。\r\n            \r\n             就消费者而言，在任何给定时间都会“拥有”此缓冲区的连续部分。\r\n             （我们认为能够包裹起来的此缓冲区的连续部分\r\n             开始。缓冲区以“圆形”方式访问。）考虑这部分\r\n             分为三个不同的区域：有一种中间的“采样”区域\r\n             （通常是p的大小，但当我们到达输入末端时可能较小，因此\r\n             用完排成样品），该采样区域之前的区域已经组成\r\n             采样的“死”行，并在此采样区域之后一个“预采样”区域\r\n             准备在以后的迭代中进行采样的行，但我们还没有取样（按顺序\r\n             在任何给定时间采样P项目中的简单逻辑模型等效）。\r\n             生产者拥有消费者拥有的部分的补充。\r\n            \r\n             随着光标的进展，生产者在其部分中填写了连续的项目\r\n             它拥有的缓冲区并将其传递给消费者（一次不是一个项目，而是在\r\n             批处理，以减少执行程序的量）。消费者除了\r\n             将这些物品的所有权也定期将死物品转交给生产者\r\n             （同样，一次没有一个死物品，而是批次到达死亡的物品数量\r\n             一定的阈值）。\r\n            \r\n             使用两对BufferBlock实例完成了此通信\r\n             通知生产商和消费者可以拥有多少其他物品\r\n             的。\r\n            \r\n             随着消费者每次移动到可选行的池中“选择”一行\r\n             下一行，此随机选择的行被认为是“第一个”索引，因为\r\n             随后过渡到死行变得更加简单。效率低下\r\n             交换每个列的缓冲区中的所有值以完成此操作以制作选定的行\r\n             首先，当然，所以一个人换一个索引，所以这些很好的行为连续\r\n             圆形索引，通过保持置换置换在缓冲区内的索引中映射\r\n             在管道阵列中。\r\n            \r\n             结果在功能上等同于，但要快得多\r\n             第一段中描述的简单实现。\r\n             \r\n","The scored data.":"得分数据。\r\n","\r\n            Gets or sets 'id_token_hint'.\r\n            ":"\r\n            获取或设置“ id_token_hint”。\r\n            \r\n"," with\r\n            appropriate initial schema.
