In general, user-editable control properties, such as those of text boxes and check boxes, default to two-way bindings, whereas most other properties default to one-way bindings. A programmatic way to determine whether a dependency property binds one-way or two-way by default is to get the property metadata of the property using ":" 结合目标的值。每个依赖项属性的默认值各不相同。通常，用户编辑的控制属性，例如文本框和复选框的控制属性，默认为双向绑定，而大多数其他属性默认为单向绑定。默认情况下，确定依赖性属性是单向还是双向绑定的一种程序化方法是使用该属性的属性元数据\r\n","Represents a method to be called after the validation of an object.":"表示在验证对象后要调用的方法。\r\n",".
